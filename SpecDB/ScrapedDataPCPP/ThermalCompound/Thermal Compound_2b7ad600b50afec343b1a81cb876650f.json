    "name": "Noctua NT-H1 3.5 g Thermal Paste",
    "Manufacturer": "Noctua",
    "Part #": "[NT-H1, NT-H1 3.5g]",
    "Amount": "3.5 g",
    "Features": "[Excellent performance: NT-H1 consists of a hybrid compound of different micro-particles, which has been specifically optimized for use in PC environments. Thanks to its extremely low thermal resistance as well as excellent pliability and spreadability, NT-H1 achieves outstanding results., Maximum ease of use & efficient dosage: As NT-H1 spreads very well under pressure, there's no need to smear it over the heat-spreader. This reduces both the consumption of paste and the time spent on the installation process: Put one drop of NT-H1 onto the centre of your CPU, install the cooler and that's it!, Top-performance right from the start: NT-H1 reaches its full performance extremely fast and doesn't require a longer \"burn-in\" time., Excellent long-term stability: NT-H1 doesn't contain any solvents or other substances with low flash point and provides excellent long-term stability. Due to the compound's exceptional curing, bleeding, dry-out und thermal cycling characteristics, NT-H1 can be used for several years without any problems., Not electrically conductive, non-corroding: NT-H1 possesses a very low dielectric constant and a high dielectric strength. Therefore, there's no danger of short-circuits even in case of direct contact with components or conducting paths. Fully compatible with all materials commonly employed in PC environments, NT-H1 is suited for use with aluminium and copper coolers., Suitable for compressor cooling: NT-H1 is perfectly suited for use with compressor coolers. Even at the very lowest temperatures, the paste delivers full performance and remains easy to clean off.]",
