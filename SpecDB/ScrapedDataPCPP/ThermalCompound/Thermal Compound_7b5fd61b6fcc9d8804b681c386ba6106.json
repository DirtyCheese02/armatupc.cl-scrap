    "name": "ARCTIC MX-4 4 g Thermal Paste",
    "Manufacturer": "ARCTIC",
    "Part #": "[AC-MX4, ORACO-MX40001-BL]",
    "Amount": "4 g",
    "Features": "[Easy Application, Optimal Thermal Conductivity, Low Thermal Resistance, Non-Electrical Conductive, Non-Capacitive, Non-Corrosive, No Curing, No Bleeding, Thermal Conductivity (W/mk): 8.5, Viscosity (poise): 870, Density (g/cm3): 2.5, Net Weight: 4g, The ARCTIC MX-4  is a premium-grade thermal paste with exceptional performance and ease of application. It is an electrically non-conductive paste that is applied between CPU/GPU and designated coolers to transfer the dissipated heat from the components to the heat sink. Since the ARCTIC MX-4  is a metal-free compound, it eliminates the risks of causing short circuit and in turn adding more protection to your computer., The new formula in the ARCTIC MX-4 features optimal thermal conductivity and low thermal resistance. These characteristics effectively dissipate the emitted heat from the core components., The consistency of the ARCTIC MX-4 is designed for simple application. Its texture is just thin enough to spread onto components using fingers without creating much mess.]",
