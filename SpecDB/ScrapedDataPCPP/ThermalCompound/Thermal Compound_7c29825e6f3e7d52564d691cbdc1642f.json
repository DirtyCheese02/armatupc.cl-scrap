    "name": "Arctic Silver 5 High-Density Polysynthetic Silver 3.5 g Thermal Paste",
    "Manufacturer": "Arctic Silver",
    "Model": "5 High-Density Polysynthetic Silver",
    "Part #": "[AS5-3.5G, AS-AS5-35]",
    "Amount": "3.5 g",
    "Features": "[Three unique shapes and sizes of pure silver particles to maximize particle-to-particle contact area and thermal transfer., Contains over 88% thermally conductive filler by weight.These thermally-enhanced ceramic particles improve the compound's performance and long-term stability, Ensure the best physical contact between the heatsink and the CPU core., Will not separate, run, migrate, or bleed., 3.5-gram, Average Particle Size: <0.49 micron <0.000020 inch, Extended Temperature Limits: Peak: -50 Degrees C to >180 Degrees C, Long-Term: -50 Degrees C to 130 Degrees C, Performance: 3 to 12 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core., Coverage Area: A 3.5 gram syringe contains enough compound to cover at least 15 to 25 small CPU cores, or 6 to 10 large CPU cores, or 2 to 5 heat plates. At a layer 0.003\" thick, the 3.5 gram syringe will cover approximately 16 square inches.]",
