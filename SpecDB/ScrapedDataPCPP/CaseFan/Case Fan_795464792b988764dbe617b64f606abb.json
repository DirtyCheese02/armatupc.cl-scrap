This pressure is essential for cooling radiators and CPU heatsinks., Quietest High Performance / High Pressure Fan In Its Class: The FX's unique curved housing reduces turbulence caused by airflow reflected off surfaces, resulting in better airflow, static pressure and reduced noise., Designed for Chassis and Radiator: The FX fans were designed to excell at both high airflow and high static pressure. These fans perform equally well to the task, regardless of being installed in a chassis or on a radiator., Teflon Nano-Steel Bearings allow for quiet and long-lasting performance., PWM 4-Pin connector allows you to control the fan via PWM signal, ensuring that the fans spin exactly the way you want!, Tapered EVGA Fan Blade improves airflow and creates a unique look while spinning.]",
