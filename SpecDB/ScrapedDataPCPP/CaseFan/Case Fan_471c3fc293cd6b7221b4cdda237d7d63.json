Smaller, domed motor hub, larger, more dramatic fan blade sweep area, they offer unrivaled performance along with a noise characteristic that makes it a favorite among professionals. There might be fans that offer more airflow or lower noise levels, but when it comes to a balance between the two, these fans can't be beat, especially with fluid dynamic bearings for ultra long life and reduced vibration.",
