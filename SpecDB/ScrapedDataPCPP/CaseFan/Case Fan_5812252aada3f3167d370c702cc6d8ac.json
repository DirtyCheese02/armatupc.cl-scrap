    "Features": "[Featuring hydraulic bearings; a cost-efficient compromise between a standard sleeve bearing and a true FDB, bearing, Equipped with a counter-balancing magnet in the hub that reduces the axial tension on the bearing, further protecting, the longevity of the bearing, Optimized fan geometry for a good balance between static pressure and maximum airflow, resulting in good performance, in all usage scenarios, Aerodynamically shaped thin stator struts (including wire strut), mimicking the design commonly found on airplane, wings, delivering correct angles allowing for air to easily pass through reducing noise and unwanted turbulence., Stator struts are angled perpendicular to the blades, helping to reduce noise commonly emitted when the blades, pass the struts. In effect, minimal noise that may be emitted will be constant and therefore almost inaudible to the, ear., Strategically placed notches near the fan hub on the trailing edge of the blades, further reducing and diffusing, humming noise produced when the blades pass the stator struts, Includes a “trip wire” on the rear side of the blades, near the leading edge. The trip wire technology, also commonly, found in airplane wing designs, introduces a micro-turbulent layer that helps to combat the elements that negatively, affect performance. The presence of the trip wire overall provides a more efficient and quiet fan environment., The customized design of the Dynamic Series fans contributes to a beautiful, cool build, Available in 120mm and 140mm fan sizes]",
