Ideal for moving large volumes of hot air from your case, our unique fan is heavily inspired by the turbines found in Turboprop jet engines. This incredibly efficient design allows maximum movement of air, which removes heat from your case while circulating cooler air from the outside. The RGB capability gives you three separate lighting modes to add more style to your build, and layered noise reduction and jam protection technology keeps all of your hassles to a minimum.",
