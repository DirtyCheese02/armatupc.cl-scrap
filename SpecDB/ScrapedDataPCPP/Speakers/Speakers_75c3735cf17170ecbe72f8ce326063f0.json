With a glossy finish augmented by an acoustically slanted front, the Inspire T10 re-introduces desktop speakers in a whole new light, be it for your PC, Mac or MP3., More music, more detail, Imagine being able to pick up even the soft clamour of a \"Ride\" cymbal in a slow rock song. With a dedicated tweeter and two-way design, you can fully appreciate performances that are rich in high frequencies, such as those with clarinets and strings., All bass, less space, The exclusive space-saving BasXPort means you don't really need an additional subwoofer to enjoy deep bass music. Acoustically engineered to enhance the lower midrange, BasXPort channels the sound waves efficiently from the inner chamber to the soundstage. What you get is music that has more weight - without a third box., Extended listening, The built-in headphone jack and AUX In connector makes it easy to plug in your headphones for private listening, or play music from your MP3 player or any other analog audio devices.]",
